# movieDatabase
Database class project.

Software and framework we utilized:
  MySQL workbench
  Eclipse IDE for Java
  OS :: Windows 10

Hardware needed:
  Intel core i3 or higher
  4GB of RAM or higher
  
To run the program you will need to download MYSQL workbench and the Eclipse IDE.
Make sure to setup MYSQL user to "root" and provide any password you would like.
Once you have done that set up a new project and name it MovieProject or what ever you prefer.
Then when your package is ready you can open the source code provided and follow these instructions
to insure that the code will work on your device.

When the code is loaded on Eclipse go through and find every //CHANGE PASSWORD and change the previous users 
code so it matches your password to MYSQL. This is how Java will connect to MYSQL.
You will also want to find where it says //CHANGE file LOCATION. This is where you have the two specific
files located on your device. The easiest way to find that information is to right click on the file and go to it's properties.
There you will find the location of the file and make sure that you add (\file name) at the end of the location or it will
not work. Next you will want to create a new Schemas in MYSQl. This will be where your tables will be crated by the Java program.
You can name the Schemas what ever you like. After it is created, right click on the new Schemas and set it as the default Schemas.
Once that is done you should be able to run the program on Java and it should connect to MYSQL and load up the tables along with
all of the data that it will pull from the text files.

Then you should see all of the code working and loading up the user text interface and you will be able to choose each option from there.

Thank you for using our database!
